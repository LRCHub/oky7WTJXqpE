Maybe he will come out this
maybe he won't
somehow i'm not too bothered
either way

maybe he will come out of this loving me
maybe he will come out of this
i smell declarations of solitude
maybe he will come out of this

once it was simple
one feeling at a time
it reached this peak then transformed
these abstract complex feelings
i just don't know
how to handle them
should i throw oil
on one of his moods
but which one
make joy peak
anything peak

maybe he will come out of this loving me
maybe he won't
i'm not taming no animal
maybe he will come out of this

maybe he will come out of this
maybe he won't
somehow i'm not too bothered
either way
somehow i'm not too bothered
either way

i refuse, it's a sign of maturity
to be stuck in complexity

i demand clarity
either way

maybe he will come out of this
or he will feel solitaire
somehow i'm not too bothered
i'd just like to know
